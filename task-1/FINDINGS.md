# Findings Summary

## Identified Issues:

1. **Validation Feedback:**
   - The validation error message was generic, providing limited information to users.

2. **API Endpoint Assumption:**
   - The code assumed the existence of the API endpoint ('/api/recipes') without explicit validation.

3. **Error Handling in API Call:**
   - There was no comprehensive error handling for the API call, leaving potential failures unmanaged.

## Approaches Taken:

1. **Validation Feedback:**
   - Improved the validation feedback by providing more informative error messages for each required field.

2. **API Endpoint Validation:**
   - Addressed the assumption of the API endpoint by introducing a variable (`apiUrl`) for better management.
   - If the API endpoint is invalid or missing, appropriate error messages are logged and displayed.

3. **Error Handling in API Call:**
   - Enhanced error handling for the API call to manage failed requests effectively.
   - Displayed an alert message on the client side for users in case of API call failure.

4. **Additional Improvement:**
   - Ensured that form fields are cleared on successful submission, providing a better user experience.
