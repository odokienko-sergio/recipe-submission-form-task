# Performance Optimization Summary

## 1. Caching Recent Recipes

### Original Code
The original code did not implement any caching mechanism for recent recipes, resulting in redundant API calls.

### Optimization
Implemented a caching mechanism to store recent recipes data. Subsequent requests check the cache first, reducing unnecessary API calls and improving load times.

### Expected Performance Improvement
Significant reduction in API calls for recent recipes, leading to faster page load times and reduced server load.

## 2. Absolute URLs for API Requests

### Original Code
API requests were made using relative URLs, potentially causing issues with URL resolution.

### Optimization
Modified API request URLs to use absolute URLs with the origin of the current window. This ensures consistent and correct URL resolution.

### Expected Performance Improvement
Avoids potential URL resolution issues and ensures the reliability of API requests.

## 3. Dynamic Rendering of Recipes

### Original Code
The original code statically inserted recipe HTML into the DOM.

### Optimization
Dynamically renders recipe HTML based on the fetched data. This allows for more flexibility and efficiency in handling various recipes.

### Expected Performance Improvement
Improved flexibility in rendering recipes, potential for better user experience, and reduced DOM manipulation overhead.

## 4. Improved Error Handling

### Original Code
Limited error handling in the original code.

### Optimization
Enhanced error handling in the `loadRecipes` function to gracefully handle errors and display error messages to the user.

### Expected Performance Improvement
Improved user experience by providing clear error messages in case of API request failures.

## 5. Miscellaneous Changes

### Optimization
- Updated comments in the code for better readability and understanding.
- Removed unnecessary TODO comments.
- Organized code structure for clarity.

### Expected Performance Improvement
Improved code readability, maintainability, and understanding for developers.
